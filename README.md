============

This is a simple starter project that focused on extending a simple pipeline.

The pipeline will load all "steps" and run them

To extend this, simply write your own step and add it to the config, then run the pipeline

STEPS libary:

uppercase - Converts the given input string to uppercase
date      - Appends current date to the input string
duplicate - Appends a duplicate of the input string to itself
